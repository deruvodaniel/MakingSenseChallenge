# Install Dependencies

## The challenge

The client has requested you to build out this Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible keeping in mind simplicity and ease-of-use.

Deliver the complete experience using HTML, CSS (SASS) and JS. You can't use CSS frameworks/toolkits nor JS plugins.

The Dashboard should display correctly in Desktop, Tablet and Mobile. You'll only receive a desktop mockup. On mobile, the user should to be able to view as much information on the screen as posible, without losing the design's coherence. 

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View more information about a specific social media account through a modal. For the chart the team has agreed on using the following library: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line.html
- Toggle color theme to their preference

On delivery, please provide clear explanations about your decision-making process for the responsive approach. Document code as much as possible as well.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Some tips

1. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead your CSS to make it reusable. 

2. You can deliver everything else you consider necessary to support your solution.

3. Pay special attention to the details.


## Deliverables

- Complete project files working on Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Edge and project's documentation. You can deliver on a zip or through a GitHub repository.

**Have fun building!**
